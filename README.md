👋 Hi, I'm Gustavo Kennedy Renkel. I was born in the 90's, from an exemplary family structure, my parents taught me values ​​that I always carry with me, which are humility, courage and respect. In my childhood I always liked to create things and to take risks (dangerous games). Since I was little, something always fascinated me, “how can people create amazing things?”.

I attended public school until I finished high school. I've always been passionate about technology, and at the age of 8 I started creating websites. Fascinated by that, I tried to study, entered and graduated in Computer Technician at the Instituto Federal Catarinense de Rio do Sul, where the TCC was the visual restructuring of a web application.

Then, I started my degree in Graphic Design at UNIDAVI – University Center for the Development of Alto Vale do Itajaí. Where I graduated in 2015. And out of a hunger for innovation and knowledge, I completed the Postgraduate Degree in Neuromarketing in 2019.

My hobbies are bodybuilding, cycling, football, blogging.
